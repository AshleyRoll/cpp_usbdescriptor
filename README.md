# C++20 Constexpr USB descriptor generator

Experiments in C++20 Compile-time generation of USB descriptors

## Notes

This is experimental and currently doesn't generate all required descriptors. However, it can be used
as the basis for further refinement.

I intend, as time permits, to complete the implementation and provide a header-only library to make
the generation and use of USB descriptors simple, safe and easy for embedded firmware projects.
